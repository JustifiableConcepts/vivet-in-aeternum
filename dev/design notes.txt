NOTES ON CARD DESIGN

MOCK UP V 1 – Done: 12/18/14
Top info = Name and Cost Circle [Maybe color of stroke on name can mean something?][Color of swirl as well?]
Bottom Info = Card Type [Manakoa or Criatura Mítico or Blessed/Cursed Hallow] Special attribute[if any] Special attribute [if any] Relic origin. Attack and Defense Octagon and Health Banner.


- Card art will encompass the whole card [ 3x4 in working model ] with the information contained in as minimal box space as possible. Meaning if the information is shorter so too shall the box which contains it. [workable] 

THE ART IS KING IN VIA!

## Play mode ideas:

#### 6-card-cycle
Every round 6 artifacts are drawn from the satchel. After that turn, any non-played artifacts are discarded. If the satchel runs empty, the discard pile is shuffled and dealt.

The goal of this style play is keep the game moving, rather than hoarding a cards for a specific play, every turn the player gets a great chance to make a master play.

Somethings to consider:
  - This does not affect the "Mana" build up. Great card at the beginning? Sorry folks.
  - Cards in play, do they get KO'd (Permanent discard) or get put back in the deck? Do the artifacts produce a impression or a residual copy of the original?
  - Do players start with a deck of 10, then get a chance to escavate new artifacts?
