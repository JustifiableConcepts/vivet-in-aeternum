This game is the brain child of Nelson V. Carrasquillo & Grayson A.C. Laramore. 

The game is Free-To-Play and is planned to stay that way for it's life time, any commercial sale of the original material is forebidden.

You are allowed to create any extensions from your own artwork and concepts and apply to have it added to the final build, credit must be given back to us and our work here. The creator will have its work voted on by the community and from there will be determined if it will join the ViA universe, the creator of the extension(s) will be compensated for their work based on a set criteria later down the road [don't worry we're not interested on shafting people for their hard work, we want to help support creators as they help support us.]
