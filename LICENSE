This game is the brain child of Nelson V. Carrasquillo & Grayson A.C. Laramore. 

The game is open and free to modify, however any commercial sale of the original material is forebidden.

You are allowed to sell any extensions you create from your own artwork and concepts, but credit must be given back to us and our work here.
