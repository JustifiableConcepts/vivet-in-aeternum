We love the idea of you taking the game we've created and playing the heroes and villans of the stories you want to play. 

To keep the game fun however, one shouldn't be too over powered or underpowered for that matter. To help make this process easier, we've created a matrix of stats. 

The base attack is 2. Max is 12.
Base Defense is 1. Max is 11.
