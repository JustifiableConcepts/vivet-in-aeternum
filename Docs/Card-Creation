We love the idea of you taking the game we've created and playing the heroes and villans of the stories you want to play. 

To keep the game fun however, one shouldn't be too over powered or underpowered for that matter. To help make this process easier, we've created a matrix of stats. 

The base attack is 2. Max is 12.
Base Defense is 1. Max is 11.

For ease of your own character creation : 
Google Spreadsheets has 3 columns: (but use whatever spreadsheet you wanna use)
1. atk (Column A)
2. def (Column B)
3. mana (Column C)
````
// Average of ATK & DEF, downed down. Times 100
PRODUCT(100,ROUNDDOWN(AVERAGE(A2,B2))))
```

Summary 
````
=CONCATENATE(A2,"/",B2," = ",PRODUCT(100,ROUNDDOWN(AVERAGE(A2,B2))))
